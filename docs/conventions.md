# Conventions

## Anchor ported code to upstream

Every ported item names its typescript-go counterpart in a doc comment:

```rust
/// Ported from typescript-go's `core.PagedLinkStore`
/// (`internal/core/linkstore.go`).
```

**Why:** we chose an idiomatic rewrite ([ADR-0001](adr/0001-idiomatic-rewrite.md)),
which means upstream fixes cannot be diffed and replayed onto our tree — each one
must be re-derived by hand. The anchors are what let a drift tracker map an
upstream commit touching `internal/checker/relations.go` to the Rust items
claiming to port it. Without them, tracking a moving 60k-LOC checker is
archaeology.

This is oxc's own practice in `oxc_type_checker`, and it is the difference between
mechanical drift tracking and manual review of every upstream commit.

## Generated code is never hand-edited

`crates/tsr-ast/src/generated/` is produced by `cargo xtask codegen`. It is checked
in so a plain `cargo build` works without the submodule; CI regenerates and diffs
to prove it has not gone stale. Hand-editing it produces a change that silently
reverts on the next regeneration.

## Codegen fails loudly

The generator `bail!`s on any upstream construct it does not recognise, rather
than falling back to a permissive default.

**Why:** an earlier version degraded unmapped types to an opaque `Node`, which
quietly hid 15 token-alias types. A generator that silently copes is a generator
whose output nobody can trust. The cost of failing loudly is one line added to a
match arm; the cost of coping quietly is a conformance gap discovered a year later.

## Tests that depend on the submodule skip, not fail

Conformance tests read `vendor/typescript-go`. When it is absent they print a skip
notice and return, so a checkout without submodules still runs the unit suite. CI
checks out submodules, so the real assertions always run somewhere.

## Prefer measured facts to assertions

In docs, comments, and commit messages: "upstream reads `.Parent` 2,092 times
across `checker`/`ls`/`binder`" is worth more than "parent access is hot". Cite
paths. Anchor to the pinned commit.

## Macros over hand-written repetition

With 351 syntax kinds and 192 node types, anything written per-node is written
wrong eventually. Declarative macros (`define_index!`, `side_tables!`) for
structural repetition within a crate; `xtask` codegen for anything derived from
upstream.

## Never report an unimplemented stage as passing

A conformance suite whose subject does not exist reports **0%**, loudly, with the
reason stated. It does not skip, and it does not omit the row. A missing number
and a zero look identical in a summary table, and only one of them is honest.
