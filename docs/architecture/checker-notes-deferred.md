# Deferred type constructs — `keyof`, indexed access, mapped and conditional types

This page owns the family of type constructs the checker answers with a
**print-only mint** or not at all: `keyof X`, `X[Y]`, `{ [K in K']: T }` and
`A extends B ? C : D`. `keyof` and indexed access have partial arms (§34, §35 of
[checker-notes-callres.md](checker-notes-callres.md), extended by §786 and §806);
mapped and conditional type *nodes* have **no arm at all** and fall through
`get_type_from_type_node`'s catch-all to `errorType`.

They belong on one page because one mechanism serves all four, and because the
interesting work is never the mint itself — it is deciding which operand shapes
it may serve without manufacturing a wrong line, and which *consumers*
downstream have to know a mint when they see one.

## §812 — the mints were `ANY`, and an `ANY` constituent eats its own union

Measured at `8187d2d9` (§811), on a freshly accepted `scorepair` baseline:

```
TOTAL 474,243   right 437,946   gap 7,448   wrong 28,849
checker_types 6,116/9,538 = 64.12% cases, 437,946/478,855 = 91.46% lines
```

§34 and §35 mint a deferred `keyof T` / `T[K]` as a print-only citizen: the
written text, registered in `unresolved_types` so `is_error` stays true and the
diagnostic channel is untouched. Both minted it with `TypeFlags::ANY`.

An `any` constituent **absorbs its whole union**. So `keyof T | keyof U` was
reduced to a bare `any` before anything could print it, and the corpus says so
in the plainest possible way — `keyofAndIndexedAccessErrors` holds 24 lines
reading:

```
want  keyof T & keyof U          got  any
want  keyof T | keyof U          got  any
want  (T | U)[keyof T & keyof U] got  any
```

**§36 had already met this exact problem and solved it, and recorded the reason
at the site**, in `declared.rs`'s template-literal arm:

> OBJECT rather than the §31 mints' ANY: a template mint in a UNION must not
> trip any-absorption or string-literal reduction.

So §812 is that one word, two constructs over. It is not a new idea; it is a
comment that had been sitting one match arm away for several hundred builds.

### Score, §812 alone

```
right 437,946 → 438,008  (+62)     gap 7,448 → 7,418     wrong 28,849 → 28,817
GAP→RIGHT 24   WRONG→RIGHT 44   |   RIGHT→WRONG 6   GAP→WRONG 6
```

The 6 `GAP→WRONG` are the finding, not the cost — see §813.

---

## §813 — the intersection gate was narrower than upstream, and the gap was hiding it

The six lines §812 turned from gap into wrong all wanted the same thing:

```
want   T[K] & ({} | undefined)          got   T[K]
want   T[K] & ({} | null)               got   T[K]
```

That is §85's `T & {}` family one construct over. **Before §812 the whole line
was `error`** — an `ANY` mint under narrowing stayed `any` — so the gap was
concealing the missing arm rather than protecting anything. Converting a gap into
a wrong line is how a build finds out what the gap was covering for, which is the
§90-diagnostics finding (*a decline can conceal a bug rather than prevent one*)
arriving from the other direction.

### What upstream gates on — read, not inferred

`get_type_with_facts` gated the intersection road on
`TypeFlags::TYPE_PARAMETER | TypeFlags::UNKNOWN`. Upstream gates on nothing of
the kind. `getAdjustedTypeWithFacts` (`checker.go:31159`) dispatches on the
**fact**, and `removeNullableByIntersection` (`checker.go:31179`) then maps over
the operand's constituents asking only `hasTypeFacts(t, targetFacts)` — *can this
constituent compare equal to the nullable I am removing?* A deferred `T[K]` can,
so upstream intersects it exactly as it intersects `T`.

The type-parameter gate was therefore an artefact of what this port could express
when §85 was written, and widening it to the deferred mints moves **toward**
upstream rather than away.

### Why a new set rather than an existing one

`Checker::deferred_index_mints`, populated at both mint sites. Not the existing
alternatives:

- **`unresolved_types` is too wide.** The §31 type-reference mint is in it, and
  upstream *has* a real resolved type for `Foo<T>` whose facts it can read.
- **`deferred_keyof_types` (§786) answers a different question** — *is this mint
  usable as a generic index?* — and holds only the `keyof` half, not the
  indexed-access half this arm needs.

Two sets over the same types, each named for the question it answers, is cheaper
than one set whose meaning depends on the caller.

---

## §814 — the ORDER was wrong, and that is what made the FIRST guard answer bare

With §813 in, three of the six converted and three did not. The split is the
finding:

| the reference | its operand | before §814 |
|---|---|---|
| the first `x;` after `if (x === undefined) return` | `T[K] \| undefined` | `T[K]` — **wrong** |
| the second `x;`, after a second identical guard | `T[K]` | `T[K] & ({} \| null)` — right |

The first narrowing sees the **union**; a union is neither a type variable nor a
mint, so the gate declined and the filter road answered a bare `T[K]`. Only the
*second* narrowing, whose operand is already that bare mint, reached the
intersection at all.

Upstream has no such asymmetry, because it does the two things **in order**:

```go
func (c *Checker) getAdjustedTypeWithFacts(t *Type, facts TypeFacts) *Type {
    reduced := c.recombineUnknownType(c.getTypeWithFacts(…, facts))   // FILTER first
    if c.strictNullChecks {
        switch facts {
        case TypeFactsNEUndefined:
            return c.removeNullableByIntersection(reduced, …)         // then INTERSECT
```

This port folded both into `get_type_with_facts` and put the intersection
**before** the filter, so the intersection could only ever see an operand that
was already free of its nullable. Restored: attempt the mint on the operand,
then, if the filter changed anything, on what the filter left. The mint block is
now `Checker::non_null_mint` returning `Option`, so both attempts share one
implementation instead of one being a copy of the other.

### The second attempt is restricted to deferred mints, and the restriction is measured

Ungated, the second attempt also reaches type parameters. Measured over the whole
corpus (on the §88.1-era rehearsal of this build, where the rows were
individually attributable):

| | lines |
|---|---|
| gained — `typeVariableTypeGuards:88` (`obj : NonNullable<T>`), `unknownControlFlow:349` (`y : T & ({} \| undefined)`) | +2 |
| lost — `indexedAccessConstraints:26` wants a bare `T` and got `NonNullable<T>`; `controlFlowGenericTypes:291` wants `T` and got `T & ({} \| null)` | −2 |

**Net zero for two regressed cases.** So the type-parameter half is left out and
filed as its own item: it needs a measurement of *when* upstream's `mapType`
declines, which is a different question from this build's. §85's measured road is
untouched, and the `// PROBE:` comment already sitting in that function
(`flow.rs`, the `NE_UNDEFINED_OR_NULL` arm) is about the same seam and is
likewise left alone.

## §814.1 — the score, and the one leg that fired

**LANDED.** `scorepair`, full run, against the `8187d2d9` baseline:

```
right 437,946 → 438,014  (+68)     gap 7,448 → 7,418     wrong 28,849 → 28,811
GAP→RIGHT 30   WRONG→RIGHT 44   |   RIGHT→WRONG 6   GAP→WRONG 0
gradient 91.46% → 91.47%
```

**Zero `GAP→WRONG`**: every one of the six §812 alone produced is converted by
§813 and §814.

| leg | bar | read | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | gained ≥ 40 | **74 gained, net +68** | PASS |
| 2 | RIGHT→WRONG ≤ 5 | **6** | **FIRED** — see below |
| 3 | not one case | 6 cases converted | PASS |
| 4 | cases regressed == 0 | 0 | PASS |

### Leg 2 fired at 6, and all six are one net-zero spelling swap

Every one is in `narrowingByTypeofInSwitch`, and **every one is paired by a
`WRONG → RIGHT` in the same case**: 6 out, 6 in, net zero.

The case asks for **two different spellings of the same narrowing at two
adjacent sites** (`narrowingByTypeofInSwitch.types:781-790`):

```ts
case 'number': assertNumber(k); assertKeyofS(k); return;
>k : number                 ← the argument to assertNumber(x: number)
>k : keyof S & number       ← the argument to assertKeyofS(k1: keyof S)
```

`k` is `keyof S` narrowed by `typeof k === 'number'`, and upstream prints the
narrowed type differently according to the contextual type at each site. This
port computes one position-independent narrowing and therefore prints **one** of
the two spellings at both. Before this build the `ANY` mint made that spelling
`number`; now the `OBJECT` mint makes it `keyof S & number`. Which site is right
was a coin flip, and the coin landed the other way round.

> **This was first written up as an alignment artefact, and that was wrong.** The
> baseline was then read and it holds two genuinely distinct `>k :` lines. The
> correction is recorded rather than edited away, because *"it is only an
> alignment artefact"* is exactly the kind of dismissal that should cost
> something to make.

The real owner is **site-sensitive narrowing spellings** — the per-site printing
context that §81 refused and that `TASK.md` lists as three separate heads. Not
this build's, and not gateable from here.

### What converted, by shape

| wanted shape | mechanism |
|---|---|
| `keyof T \| keyof U`, `keyof T & keyof U`, `(T \| U)[keyof T & keyof U]` | §812 — the mint no longer absorbs its union |
| `T[K] & ({} \| undefined)`, `T[K] & ({} \| null)` | §813 + §814 |
| `T[K] \| undefined`, `T[K] \| null` | §812 |
| `JSX.IntrinsicElements[T]` | §812, the indexed-access half |

Cases: `keyofAndIndexedAccessErrors` 24, `indexedAccessAndNullableNarrowing` 12,
`mappedTypeGenericWithKnownKeys` 6, `optionalParameterRetainsNull` 6,
`jsxIntrinsicElementsCompatability` 3, and the `narrowingByTypeofInSwitch` swap.

Pinned by `crates/tsr-checker/tests/deferred_index_mint.rs`.

### §814's residue, recorded as unmeasured rather than guessed

`T[K] | null | undefined` under two guards of opposite kind answers
`T[K] & ({} | undefined)`, not `T[K] & {}`: the first guard's filtered result is
the union `T[K] | null` rather than a mint, so §814's second attempt declines and
no prior kind is recorded for the second guard to refine.

**The expectation written first was `T[K] & {}`**, from reading
`removeNullableByIntersection`'s lattice. It was withdrawn on finding that the
string `X[Y] & {}` **occurs in no `.types` baseline in the corpus** — so there is
no evidence for either answer, and the test pins current behaviour while saying
in as many words that it is a description and not an oracle. The fix, if a
baseline for the shape ever appears, is to carry the prior kind through a
filtered union rather than only through a bare mint.

---

## §815 — what this family has left, sized and NOT built

Three heads, in the order the evidence supports. **None is built**; this section
states what exists, not what is coming.

1. **`keyof` over a CONCRETE operand — the premise §35 rests on is false.**
   §35 declines any operand that is not a bare type parameter, on the recorded
   grounds that *"concrete operands resolve upstream and decline"*. Upstream
   prints `keyof A` for a concrete `A` too: `getIndexTypeEx`
   (`checker.go:26684`) falls through to `getLiteralTypeFromProperties` — so the
   *type* is a union of key literals — but that function sets
   `origin = c.newIndexType(t, IndexFlagsNone)` whenever the operand is a
   `ClassOrInterface`, a `Reference`, or aliased, and the node builder prefers a
   union's origin: `nodebuilderimpl.go:3439`. An `Index` type then prints
   `keyof <target>` unconditionally (`nodebuilderimpl.go:3472`). The corpus wants
   `keyof FooBar`, `keyof Thing`, `keyof A`, `keyof React.ReactHTML` verbatim.
   **The caution that must travel with it**: upstream's *type* there has members,
   and a mint that prints `keyof A` without them will answer a later property
   lookup wrongly. Price it as a print-only citizen, not as a resolution.
2. **`MappedTypeNode` has no arm at all** — 291 non-right lines want a
   `[K in …]` text, and `{ [K in keyof P]: P[K]; }` is wanted verbatim in
   quantity. `Checker::written_type_text` (§77) is the bounded renderer to
   extend.
3. **`ConditionalTypeNode` has no arm at all** — 177 non-right lines, plus 71
   wanting `infer`.

### The family's ceiling, and the over-attribution that nearly got costed

**Under 2,000 lines, about 0.4 points.** Stated here because the first sizing of
this family was case-level and wrong by roughly 5×: 438 of the 12,444 corpus
cases use conditional, mapped or `infer` syntax somewhere in their source, and
those cases hold **9,396 non-right lines**. Quoting that as this family's
population would be `docs/conventions.md`'s rule — *a population identified by
the shape of the answer is not thereby attributed to a mechanism* — one level up:
a population identified by the shape of the **source**. A case that uses a mapped
type also has contextual-typing and inference defects, and those own most of the
9,396.

The line-level rows (`keyof` 662, mapped 291, conditional 177, `infer` 71, with
overlap between them) are the honest figure.
