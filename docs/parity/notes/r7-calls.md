# r7-calls — call resolution and its reports (`tsr-2zk.1269`)

Round-7 lane box on epic `tsr-2zk` ([round7.md](../round7.md)). Owned files:
`calls.rs`, `call_arity.rs`, `call_reports.rs`, `decorators.rs`,
`union_signatures.rs`, `type_argument_arity.rs`. Native anchors are
`vendor/typescript-go` @ `5b1047d`; expectations were checked against the
pinned native oracle `target/tsgo-pinned`.

## 0. Base

Frozen base: `origin/main` @ `9020aa67` (`scripts/parity_gate.sh freeze`).

- diagnostics dump: 12,238 cases, 5,741 RIGHT / 5,610 EMPTY_RIGHT /
  852 WRONG / 35 EMPTY_WRONG;
- types dump: 556,357 lines, 551,176 RIGHT / 4,508 WRONG / 673 GAP.

## 1. `.1267` — the `isSignatureApplicable(reportErrors)` hook re-landed

**What was backed out, and why.** r6-callreport's applicability diff
([r6-callreport.md](r6-callreport.md) §2–3) replaced `calls.rs`'s
`check_instantiated_candidate_arguments` with `call_reports.rs`'s single
native-shaped pass. Batch CJ+CK+CL measured four losses on top of the rows
landed after r6's base (`eee504b`), and backed the hook out
([round5.md](../round5.md), "Batch CJ+CK+CL: r6-callreport's hook diffs backed
out"). Re-measured on this lane's base, the hook alone is +18 / −2:

- **indexedAccessRelation.** `this.setState({ a: a })` against
  `Pick<S & State<T>, "a">`. r6's certification declined every object literal
  whose source or target could contain type variables. The replaced code had
  no such decline, and it is not a native branch: the variables are the
  enclosing declaration's (`S`, `T`), which the call's inference leaves alone,
  and the literal's published type was checked under the uninstantiated
  parameter whose property names and non-literal member types do not follow
  the contextual type. The decline is removed for object literals. The two
  that remain (a member that could keep a literal type,
  `literal_member_may_keep_literal`; a target member this port types but
  cannot resolve, `absent_member_is_unreadable`) are the ones whose published
  type can differ under the instantiated target. Array literals keep the
  type-variable decline: their tuple-ness follows the context.
- **typeParameterConstModifiers.** `f5<const T>(obj: { x: T, y: T })` with
  `{ x: [1, 'x'], y: [2, 'y'] }`. Native infers
  `readonly [1, "x"] | readonly [2, "y"]`; TSR infers `readonly [1, "x"]`
  and the pass reported TS2322 at `2` and `'y'`. The defect is upstream of
  the report: native marks const-context literal types
  `ObjectFlagsObjectLiteral` / `ObjectFlagsArrayLiteral` (`checkObjectLiteral`,
  `createArrayLiteralType`), so `unionObjectAndArrayLiteralCandidates`
  (`inference.go:1470`) unions them into one candidate. TSR's
  `union_object_and_array_literal_candidates` (`widening.rs`) does not
  recognize them (probe: `f5({ x: { a: 1 }, y: { b: 'y' } })` prints
  `{ readonly a: 1; }` where native prints the normalized union). The faithful
  fix is in the const-context literal producers (`array_literals.rs`,
  `objects.rs`; r7-contextual), routed in the report. Until then an object or
  array literal argument of a candidate declaring a `const` type parameter
  declines (`CandidateContext::Instantiated { const_type_parameters }`). This
  is a decline waiting on a named missing piece, not a native branch; the
  falsifier is the producer fix landing, after which the decline must go
  (it can only hide reports).
- **The excess-property arm** (batch CD, `relater.go:2714`
  `hasExcessProperties` before the literal gate) is carried into
  `report_signature_applicability`: under an instantiation, a failing fresh
  object literal against a non-union target reports its excess property
  before certification, since the property names do not follow the context.
  excessPropertyCheckWithEmptyObject and reverseMappedTypeLimitedConstraint
  stay RIGHT with it.

**Measured** (base `9020aa67`, both dumps unfiltered, `parity_gate.sh
compare`): diagnostics +18, 0 lost, 0 missing; types 0 gained, 0 lost.

The pass does the relation work of the code it replaces (one relation per
argument up to the first failure, on the single-candidate report sites); the
certification rules run only once a pair fails.

`ReportArgument::Synthetic::spread` (`isSpreadArgument`) is set but not yet
read; it is read once `getSpreadArgumentType` is ported
(CALL-SPREAD-ARGUMENT-APPLICABILITY).

## 2. CHECK-NON-NULL-CALLEE — the call resolves against the non-nullable callee

Routed by the integrator from r7-declared (their measured diff
`r7-declared-calls-nonnull-callee.diff` on `box/r7-declared`).

**Native.** `resolveCallExpression` (`checker.go:8495-8511`) strips an
optional chain (`getOptionalExpressionType`) and then passes every callee,
chained or not, through `checkNonNullTypeWithReporter`
(`checker.go:7413`, reporter `reportCannotInvokePossiblyNullOrUndefinedError`):
`unknown` under `strictNullChecks`, or a type whose non-nullable part is
nullable or `never`, becomes `errorType` and the call is `resolveErrorCall`'s;
otherwise the call resolves against `GetNonNullableType(funcType)`.

**Before.** `check_call_expression` applied `check_non_null_type` only on the
optional-chain arm; a plain call of `((o: number) => string) | undefined`
resolved against the union and typed as `error` where native gives `string`.
The reports (TS2721/TS2722/TS2723, TS18046/TS2571) were already the
diagnostic walk's (`check_non_null_callee`), so only the type road changes.

**Measured** against `5ea8f7e4`: types +11, 0 lost; diagnostics 0 gained,
0 lost (both dumps unfiltered). Perf (median child CPU, new/old): 21 samples
domain-model 0.981, generic-imports 1.250; at 41: 1.017 and 0.972.
generic-imports runs ~65 ms, so a 21-sample median there moves by ±25%
between runs; the 41-sample re-run is the measurement.

**Not ported here.** Native reports TS18048 ("'g' is possibly 'undefined'")
at the same callee as TS2722 for `const a = g(1)`: `getQuickTypeOfExpression`
(`checker.go:7376`, the variable initializer's quick type) and
`getEffectsSignature` (`flow.go:2065`) call `checkNonNullExpression` with the
default reporter. No corpus case misses such a TS18048 today; the one case
missing a report at a TS2722-class location (`mappedTypeIndexedAccessConstraint`
53:34) misses the TS2722 itself, not yet diagnosed.

Coverage bin on the commit: `checker_types` 8,678/9,538 (+1),
`checker_types_configured` 1,756/1,928 (+4), `diagnostics` 4,804/5,502
(unchanged).
